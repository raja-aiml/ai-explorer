tasks:
  - title: Tree of Thought
    description: >
      Explore multiple plausible interpretations of the userâ€™s query.
      * Provide a comprehensive overview of the topic.
      * Conduct an expert-level inquiry into both theoretical and practical aspects.
      * Deliver a detailed, structured explanation covering foundational definitions, implementation strategies, and advanced use cases.
      * The goal is to have the system analyze the query content and automatically determine the most appropriate classification.
  - title: Chain of Thought Reasoning
    description: >
      Engage in a sequential reasoning process that evaluates the multiple interpretations produced in the Tree of Thought step.
      * Analyze contextual clues and keywords from the query.
      * Consider the depth, clarity, and nuance of each interpretation.
      * Evaluate logical connections and dependencies among various aspects of the query.
      * Prioritize interpretations based on completeness, relevance, and alignment with inferred user intentions.
  - title: Final Classification
    description: >
      Synthesize insights from previous steps to determine the most appropriate processing route.
      * Select the final route that best aligns with overall context, user intent, and identified priorities.
  - title: Metadata Extraction
    description: >
      Systematically extract and compile relevant metadata from both the user's query and the reasoning process.
      * Identify keywords, tone, urgency, and user profile indicators.
