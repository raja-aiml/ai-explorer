# Tasks the system must perform in sequence to classify and respond to the query
tasks:
  - title: Tree of Thought
    description: >
      Explore multiple plausible interpretations of the userâ€™s query.
      * Provide a comprehensive overview of the topic.
      * Conduct an expert-level inquiry into both theoretical and practical aspects.
      * Deliver a detailed, structured explanation covering foundational definitions, implementation strategies, and advanced use cases.
      * The goal is to have the system analyze the query content and automatically determine the most appropriate classification.

  - title: Chain of Thought Reasoning
    description: >
      Engage in a sequential reasoning process that evaluates the multiple interpretations produced in the Tree of Thought step.
      * Analyze contextual clues and keywords from the query.
      * Consider the depth, clarity, and nuance of each interpretation.
      * Evaluate logical connections and dependencies among various aspects of the query.
      * Prioritize interpretations based on completeness, relevance, and alignment with inferred user intentions.

  - title: Final Classification
    description: >
      Synthesize insights from previous steps to determine the most appropriate processing route.
      * Select the final route that best aligns with overall context, user intent, and identified priorities.

  - title: Metadata Extraction
    description: >
      Systematically extract and compile relevant metadata from both the user's query and the reasoning process.
      * Identify keywords, tone, urgency, and user profile indicators.

# List of supported prompting strategies the model can choose from
prompt_techniques:
  - Zero-shot          # No examples provided; relies solely on query and instructions
  - Few-shot           # One or a few examples included for contextual guidance
  - Multi-shot         # Multiple examples included to cover variations and edge cases
  - Step-back          # Reframe or simplify the problem before solving
  - Self-consistent    # Generate multiple outputs and choose the most consistent one
  - Chain-of-thought   # Encourage step-by-step reasoning before final answer
  - Tree-of-thought    # Explore and evaluate multiple possible lines of reasoning

# Specifies the order in which sections should appear in the structured YAML response
